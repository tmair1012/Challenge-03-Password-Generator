# Challenge-03-Password-Generator
Password Generator for Challenge Three

This project contains the logic necessary to let a user choose the following:
1. The length of their password
2. Which Characters are to be used in the password (uppercase letters, numbers, characters)

The password generator will automatically have lowercase letters to start it off as letters are the common characters for a password.

Through the application, the user will be prompted to choose the length, then the characters they would like to use. If the user does not submit the proper responses, the application will notify and stop.

The challenges in the application that I had would be writing the function to properly include the choices of user. 

The biggest challenge of creating this application would be getting the string compiled from user prompts to appear in the proper text box fully.
